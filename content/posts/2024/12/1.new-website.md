# New Website

This is odd! Even though I've been in webdev for a _long time_, I've never actually had a personal website with anything useful on it!

I've grown a little tired of companies creating a “home on the web” for me to enjoy, only to then have it be enshittified beyond recognition, and eventually feeling forced out again. 

This recent X → Bluesky[^1] move was the final push I needed to finally spin up my own home on the internet to have a place I control the future of. A place I can make as ugly and handmade as I want, a place I can post whatever I feel like, without algorithms making or breaking it.

That being said, I've never maintained a personal blog before, so lets find out together how long this experiment lasts 🙌
