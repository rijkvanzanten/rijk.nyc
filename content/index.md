# Heya, I'm Rijk üëã

I'm a user experience designer and open-source software developer. I co-founded and am currently the lead maintainer of [Directus](https://directus.io). I also teach part time at [Parsons School of Design](https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/).

Outside of programming, [I enjoy playing music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1VzpogOest0cp0xytyp36k). I usually play bass, but you can find me on the drums or guitar as well.

While I have accounts on most major social media networks, I'm currently most active on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rijk.nyc). Drop me a note or follow over there!

## Contact

I'm best reached through [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rijk.nyc) or email: rijkvanzanten@me.com&nbsp;(personal) or rijk@directus.io&nbsp;(business).
