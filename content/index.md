# Hey, I'm Rijk ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer based in New York City. I'm passionate about building high-quality web applications and creating excellent user experiences.

I specialize in full-stack development and enjoy working with modern web technologies. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the city or working on side projects.
