# Uses

I've always appreciated learning and being inspired by what other's use in their day to day, so figured I'd share mine as well :) 

Also make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) for the uses pages of others!

## Editor + Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my text editor of choice. I've been trying [Panic's Nova](https://nova.app/) off and on since it came out, but I can't do without my peculiar VS Code settings and extensions.
- I'm currently using [Triplicate A Poly](https://mbtype.com/fonts/triplicate/) as my coding font of choice. Yes I did pay the $119 price of admission, and yes.. it's serif ðŸ‘€ I use the Poly (non-monospace) variant in the code editor, and the Code variant for terminal.
- Tabs &gt; spaces. I prefer my tab width set to 3.
- My editor is (always) in light mode using the [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) theme. Black text on a white screen is so much easier on my eyes, and prevents halation.
- To add a bit of friendliness and whimsy into the editor, I've changed the icon set to [Catppuccin Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc-icons)
- For the terminal emulator, I'm (still) relying on [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) has been interesting, but I find myself preferring the simplicity of iTerm2. I really don't do much more in terminal than running `pnpm dev` and using `git`.

## Desktop Apps

- [Arc](https://arc.net) has become my daily driver browser. Every 3 weeks or so, I try switching back to Safari â€”Â generally way less resource heavy and surprisingly fastÂ â€”Â but can't continue due to it not being Chromium.
- I use [Figma](https://figma.com) for designing things, [Notion](https://notion.com) for note taking, and [Linear](https://linear.app) for project management.

## Recording

- For video recording, I use a [Sony Alpha 6400](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilce6400-b) with a Sigma 16mm lens.
- For audio, I use a [Blue Yeti X](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/streaming-gear/yeti-x-professional-microphone.html) for calls / voice recordings, and a [Universal Audio Apollo Solo](https://www.uaudio.com/audio-interfaces/apollo-solo.html) for guitar and other instruments.

## Desk Setup

- I'm alternating between sitting and standing using an [Autonomous](https://www.autonomous.ai/home) standing desk
- My desk monitor setup is a pair of [Apple Studio Displays](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/) side by side, with my laptop in clamshell mode mounted under my desk.
- The [Keychron K15 Pro Alice](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k15-pro-alice-layout-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard) became my standard keyboard. It used to be an Apple Magic Keyboard for years and years before that.
- When I'm trying to focusÂ â€”Â and I'm not in meetings â€”Â I use the [Sony WH-1000XM5](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm5-b) to blast some music
- I'm using a M1 Pro MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM. That being said, I am planning on upgrading to an M4 Pro with 24GB of RAM in the near future.
